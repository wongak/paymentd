Administrative API
==================

.. contents::

User API
--------

The User API deals with user authentication and authorization. All administrative
API methods require a valid :http:header:`Authorization` header to be present.

Those can be obtained using the User API methods. Other services in your stack could
act as a authentication/authorization service and provide the correct
auth schemes for integrating the administrative API into your environment.

***************************
The Authorization Container
***************************

The Authorization Container is self-contained and holds all required information
for authenticating and authorizing the bearer of the container.

It is base64-encoded and encrypted using the Keys
configured in :ref:`config_api_auth_keys`.

An Authorization Container provided by :term:`paymentd` has a fixed expiry of 
**15 minutes**.

.. note::

	The expiry is subject to change. Later versions will allow configuring
	this variable.

Here is an example authorization container:

.. include:: /examples.rst
	:start-after: startPaymentdAuthContainer
	:end-before: endPaymentdAuthContainer

.. note::

	In the future, the Authorization Container structure will be replaced by
	`Macaroons <http://theory.stanford.edu/~ataly/Papers/macaroons.pdf>`_.

.. _system_user:

***************
The System User
***************

:term:`paymentd` has the notion of a system user. This unique user (in fact this is 
the only "user"-like entity present in the application), has full read/write access
on every aspect of :term:`paymentd`. This system user is similar in concept to the
UNIX ``root`` user.

***********
Cookie Auth
***********

When cookie auth is enabled (:ref:`config_api_cookie_allow_cookie_auth`)
requests will accept the ``auth`` cookie, with the authorization token as a value.

All responses containing a new authorization container will have a matching
:http:header:`Set-Cookie` header.

********************************
Authentication and Authorization
********************************

..
	TODO replace Authorization example fields with reasonable example values
	Curently dEFFEFeddedeGGEGMceokr353521234 acts as a placeholder

.. http:get:: /v1/authorization/basic
	:synopsis: Receive an authorization token for given basic auth.

	Receive an authorization token for given basic auth.

	The password must match the :ref:`system_user` password. The returned authorization
	container will identify the bearer as the :ref:`system_user`.

	The returned authorization token can be used in subsequent :http:header:`Authorization`
	headers for accessing protected resources.
